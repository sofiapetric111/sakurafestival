        <h2>A celebration of the cherry blossom</h2>
        <p>
          The Committee of the Copenhagen Sakura Festival was established in
          February, 2008 to arrange the cultural event Copenhagen Sakura
          Festival with the help of the Japanese Embassy in Denmark, the
          Municipality of Copenhagen and other Japan-related cultural and
          private organizations. The original idea came from the noble deed of
          donation of 200 cherry blossom (Sakura) trees by Mr. Seiichi Takaki,
          President of Andersen Institute of Bread & Life, the holding company
          of Andersen Group of Hiroshima City, and the employees of the company.
          The donated trees were planted in Langelinie Park. Mr. Takaki is
          Honorary Consul of Denmark and he was appointed to the honorable
          position of ambassador of H.C. Andersen on the occasion of the 200th
          anniversary of H.C. Andersenâ€™s birthday in 2005. The donated Sakura
          trees were planted in Langelinie Park.

        In Japan people love and admire Sakura blossom and almost everybody go
        out to enjoy its beauty together with families, friends, lovers,
        office-mates and so forth wherever and whenever Sakura bloom. Once a
        year Sakura connects people and people meet people under Sakura trees.
        It is also the utmost and fundamental goal of the Committee. The
        Committee has an honor to have Honorable Chairpersons H.E. the
        Ambassador of Japan to Denmark and Lord Mayor of the City of Copenhagen.
        The Committee consists of representatives of Japan related business,
        cultural and private organizations, the Municipality of Copenhagen and
        the Japanese Embassy.
